            <p>
              Mercury is the closest planet to the sun in our solar system. It's
              known as the 'heater' because of its extremely high temperature
              that can reach up to 430 degrees Celsius during the day and drop
              to minus 180 degrees Celsius at night. Mercury is also the
              smallest planet in our solar system, with a diameter only a
              quarter of Earth's. It has a very slow rotation, so one day on
              Mercury is equivalent to two orbits around the sun.

            <p>
              Venus is often called Earth's 'sister planet' due to its similar
              size and composition. However, Venus has a very different
              atmosphere, consisting mostly of carbon dioxide and clouds of
              sulfuric acid that trap heat, making it the hottest planet in our
              solar system with surface temperatures that can reach up to 471
              degrees Celsius. Venus also rotates slowly in the opposite
              direction to most planets, meaning that its day is longer than its
              year. Despite its proximity to Earth, Venus remains one of the
              most mysterious planets in our solar system, and there is still
              much to be discovered about this fascinating planet.

            <p>
              Earth is the third planet from the sun and the only known planet
              that supports life. It's often called the 'Blue Planet' because of
              its vast oceans that cover about 71% of its surface. Earth is the
              largest of the terrestrial planets and has a diverse range of
              climates and ecosystems, from freezing polar regions to scorching
              deserts, lush rainforests to vast oceans. The planet's atmosphere
              is also unique, containing the right mix of gases that allow for
              life to thrive. Earth orbits the sun at just the right distance to
              maintain liquid water on its surface, making it an ideal planet
              for sustaining life as we know it.

            <p>
              Mars is the fourth planet from the sun, known for its reddish
              appearance caused by iron oxide on its surface. It has a thin
              atmosphere mostly made of carbon dioxide and a dusty, rocky
              landscape. Scientists believe it may have had liquid water and
              potential for life. Mars is a target for future human exploration
              and colonization.
